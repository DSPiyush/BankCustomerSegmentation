In the domain of banking, customer bases exhibit elaborate and diverse properties such as age, income, values, lifestyle, etc.
Customer segmentation ie. bucketing the data into groups based on shared traits, plays a pivotal role.
Several organizations reports underscore that comprehending consumers deeply is now a strategic necessity for banking providers with the advent of data-driven commerce. 
These insights shed light on the entirety of banking operations. The dataset encompasses over a million transactions from 800K+ Indian bank customers. 
It encompasses variables like age, location, gender, account balance, transaction specifics, and amounts. We aim to achieve customer segmentation by means of various clusteringÂ algorithms.
We need to install some packages to run the code, first of all, we need to go for  pip install pyspark==3.1.2  to download the latest version.

After that following packages need to install

pip install pyarrow

pip install pandas

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install numpy

pip install scipy

Here is the Visualisation part of the project
